**Accident Detection System using Python**

The Accident Detection System is a Python-based application designed to enhance vehicle safety by identifying potential accidents in real-time. The system integrates sensor data from an accelerometer and GPS to monitor the vehicle's movements and detect sudden or unusual changes indicative of an accident. The core functionality revolves around analysing this sensor data to ensure accurate and timely detection of accidents, followed by notifying emergency contacts.

**Key Components:**

1. **Sensor Data Analysis:**
   - The system reads real-time data from an accelerometer, which measures the vehicle’s acceleration forces in different axes (X, Y, Z). It monitors for abrupt changes in acceleration that may suggest a collision or rollover.
   - The GPS sensor tracks the vehicle’s location and speed, which is crucial for determining the precise location of an accident and whether the vehicle’s movement has been significantly altered or stopped.

2. **Accident Detection Logic:**
   - The program continuously evaluates the accelerometer readings to identify thresholds that indicate an accident, such as a sharp deceleration (e.g., sudden braking or impact).
   - In combination with GPS data, the system assesses speed and location changes. If a sudden change in acceleration coincides with a dramatic drop in speed or erratic vehicle behaviour, the system flags it as a potential accident.

3. **Alert Mechanism using Twilio API:**
   - Once an accident is detected, the system automatically retrieves the vehicle’s current GPS coordinates.
   - It then triggers an alert message to predefined emergency contacts using the Twilio API. This alert includes the vehicle's location (latitude and longitude) and details of the detected event, allowing emergency services or loved ones to respond promptly.

4. **Twilio API Integration:**
   - Twilio’s SMS API is integrated to send text messages, ensuring that alerts are delivered instantly to emergency contacts.
   - The message includes a Google Maps link generated from the GPS coordinates for easy navigation to the accident location.

**System Workflow:**
1. The system collects real-time accelerometer and GPS data.
2. It processes the accelerometer data to detect sudden changes such as collisions or rollovers.
3. The GPS data is used to monitor the vehicle’s position and speed.
4. If the system determines that an accident has likely occurred, it sends an emergency alert containing the vehicle’s location to designated contacts via SMS.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python:** Core programming language for the application logic.
- **Sensor Integration:** Interfaces with accelerometer and GPS sensors to collect real-time data.
- **Twilio API:** Sends SMS alerts to emergency contacts.
- **Libraries:** Used for data processing, such as `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation, and `requests` for Twilio API interaction.

**Challenges:**
- Fine-tuning the accident detection algorithm to reduce false positives.
- Ensuring reliable data transmission in areas with poor network coverage.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Adding machine learning algorithms to improve accident detection accuracy.
- Expanding the alert system to include voice calls or integration with emergency service APIs.
- Implementing a user-friendly mobile application interface for configuration and status monitoring.
